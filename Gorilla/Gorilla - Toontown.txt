What the foghorn did you just ruffing say about me, you little noob? I’ll have you know I've soloed the Trolley of Toontown Central and I’m responsible for the dating shows of cats via Toon Valley, and I have 195 pink slips. I trained my toon to be the best in a battle of level twelves and I’m the 137 of this district. You are nothing to me but just another moocher. I will wipe you the heckle out in a method called reporting , mark my words. You think you can get away with saying meow to me on Toontown? Think again NOOB. As we speak I am contacting all my 100 laff friends and your toon is being brought to my location right now so you better prepare for greening, parker. The greening that wipes out the lovely things you call your level seven gags. You’re being sent back to the playground, kid. I can be in any lobby, anytime and green you in over 4 different bosses, and that’s just with my 34 laff uber. Not only am I trained in soloing the CEO, but I have teleport access for all of the playgrounds including the headquarters. If only you could have known what your crappy gameplay was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would of trained your gags more efficiently. But you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, I will bring you into the VP to green you. I will also dc you in the middle of a back nine and you will cry over it. You’re getting disconnected. Love your friendly little lacker.
