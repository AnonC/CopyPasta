You could start by climbing the ledges and climbing down into the Pit of Despair. Crawl through the pit, then race into the Throne Room. Sit on the Throne of the Pretender, and you could choose to go up into Medusa's Lair, where you can grab the heart-shaped pillow. OR you might journey into the Treacherous Swamp! If you escape, you might have a chance to enter the Dark Forest. Reach into the hole and find the key, but be careful, one of the trees could be inhabited by the spirit of a temple guard. If they grab you, you'll have to give up a pendant of life. Next, plow through the wall and into the Mine Shaft. Ride the elevator up into the Viper's Nest and pull the snakes from the jars to open the door to The Shrine of the Silver Monkey. Assemble the statue and you may be headed to the King's Storeroom. Smash the clay pots to find the key, which will allow you into the Observatory. Put together the puzzle on the stone column and jump back into the Pit. Then, pass through the crypt, race down the stairs, and back to the temple gate. The choices are yours and yours alone.
