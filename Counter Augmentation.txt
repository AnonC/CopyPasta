1. Everything humans make is fundamentally flawed and imperfect. Nature can never be imperfect, nature is life and everything that is evolved over a longer period of time an more dramatically than technology literally has the capability to given how infinitely late it came. Technology is and forever will be fundamentally inferior to nature.

2. The perfection and omnipotence that nature is made life dynamic. If you started a game at the highest level and with everything completed, what the fuck would you be playing? Nothing. In a life where you have all of these "gimmie" "powers," there's nothing to work towards. Your life is meaningless entirely. Everything that can be done will be done, and you will have nothing to live for. At most, you'll live for improving the flawed technology your own being is based on. You'll find misery in the knowledge you're fundamentally imperfect and replace emotion too. Then you're literally a robot, feeling nothing, and human life ceases entirely.

both assuming that none of the following are true:

3. The producer of said technology will have backdoor access to whatever part of your being this technology "augments," including complete control over its functionality and complete unpreventable surveillance of your person.
4. EMP can disable you

5. The technology will be flawed, bugged, crash, generally more cancerous than cancer itself without the ability to fight given crashing is definite: no computer that's crashed entirely simply works again. It's instant, permanent, and would require replacement that, on such a level, would be deemed impossible. So, you can die at any time with no hope.

our limitations are what make life worth living
we have everything to work towards
and if we evolve on our own by selective breeding
we can improve permanently
not temporarily

and what makes nature so witty is that even when you have the biological advantage
you still have to play the game to win it
nothing is handed to you
