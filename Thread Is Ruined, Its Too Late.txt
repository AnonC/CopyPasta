This thread is ruined. It's too late, what the hell am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do? Start the thread over? Well if I dont start over they're never going to know what its about. What the hell am I supposed to do? There's no option. I dont know what you think. Or what you think I'm going to do. It's all useless, it's failed already, it's irrevocably failed. I give up. FUCK IT. This has been totally useless. I dont know what you think I can possibly do that would help them. If they miss the first part, the most important part of this thread, the rest is going to be totally pointless anyways. I really dont see any point. It's too late dont you see. I give up. I cant stand this. I just cant stand this. There is no practical option. It's useless now, it's ruined. I want to give up because its ruined, its too late. Dont you see? This is horrible. DON'T YOU SEE HOW HORRIBLE THIS IS? I feel like everything I'm doing in this thread is useless because its failure. Total horrible failure. What the hell can I do now? I just feel so horrible. I feel so horrible I... I dont know how to get myself back into thinking anything except how horrible this thread is. You dont understand how painful it feels to have failure. And I've had so many things mess up lately that I feel totally terrible
