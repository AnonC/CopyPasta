Rev up those fryers, Krabby Patties.

My name is Fred, and I am hungry for every single one of you. All of you are fat, juicy, patties who spend every second of their day on the grill. You are everything good in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever gotten burned? I mean, I guess it's fun getting eaten by people because of your secret formula, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even better than the nasty shit at the Chum Bucket.

Don't be disgusting. Just hit me with your best shot. You're pretty much perfect. You were eaten by King Neptune, and by Squidward Tentacles. Who else have you been enjoyed by, other than pretty much everyone in Bikini Bottom? You also get straight A's in health inspections, and have a banging hot fryer (It just revved up. Shit was SO CASH). You are all delicious and should let me eat you. Thanks for listening.
