>freckles
>bump it up to 8.5/10 because dem legs
>she doesn't recognize my name
>not surprising 
>I'm betafag so I take a few days to get up the courage to tell her its me
>I tell her
>We both exchange our little 'omaigawdrly?' moments
>Shes more shy in person
>I have a bit of a soft spot for shy girls
>Crush mode engage
>Still don't talk much outside of minecraft
>We sit across the room from each other
>Not many chances for interaction
>Eventually theres a seating change
>Teacher lets us choose where to sit
>Guess where I sit
>Good job /b/! You guessed it! Next to Eliza!
>At first we're still awkward with each other
>But the awkwardness melts away after a couple weeks
>I look forward to homeroom every day now






>In the time we sit together I learn a bit more about her
>She's like me, a lonely person
>Also like me, she doesn't openly express her emotions
>One thing I notice is that she is sleepy a lot
>Like more than once I've had to wake her up in class
>She says she just sleeps a lot for some reason
>12 hours a night 
>14-16 on breaks
>Thats a neat little quirk
>I also notice that when she zones out she bites the end of her glasses with her lip
>It always makes me smile when she does it
>Aside from classwork, what we mostly do with our time in that class is draw
>We both like drawing and we start collaborating on a minecraft comic
>We make a couple characters to represent us
>I'm some dude named Dak and she names her character Ella
>Sometimes at lunch when we're alone we play like we're in minecraft
>I know, we were faggots
>We make up our own little fantasy lives in the game, like little kids
>I like it. It makes life seem a little less monotonous
>So we play these games together and slowly add to the story of our comic
>And as we do, Dak and Ella slowly get closer

Should I continue?






>I like her and I want to give it a shot with her
>But with her lack of really expressing emotions I can't tell if she likes me
>Without solid proof I won't act cuz beta
>So we continue as we are
>And I'm still loving it
>Making a move might ruin this
>So the friendzone is fine with me
>As much as I want out the unknown scares me
>Christmas rolls around the corner
>It tell Eliza that soon after break I'll be able to drive
>My birthday is on the 2nd or January
>She starts asking for rides over break as a joke
>Christmas passes and then we reach my birthday
>I didn't invite my friends, don't know why
>Just my family there
>But, before 3:00, the time of the party, theres a knock on the door
>Probably my cousin, who's always early
>But no
>It's Eliza







>I didn't invite her
>She just came
>I can't very well turn her away at the door
>I wouldn't even if I could, so I let her in
>I've never had anyone come to just see me
>My parents are surprised, knowing how lonely I am
>Eliza meets them
>Awkwardness
>My parents are the kinds who try to be 'hip'
>Oh god
>I quickly drag Eliza upstairs to my room
>She's laughing at my parents when we get up there
>My face was as red as the Soviet flag
>I ask her how she knew where I live
>She says she just asked my friend Anon#2
>I asked her why she was here
>She said for my birthday
>I didn't invite you
>"Do you want me to leave?"
>No
>I really want her to stay
>We play some call of duty
>We get in a debate about PS3 vs. XBOX360
>I win the debate being on PS3's side
>Although she doesn't admit it
>And so waiting for 3 o'clock to come by we play games and call each other names









warning to you guys, this is actually a beta story about how i almost fucked everything up

>She starts coming over more often
>I have some foam nerf swords that she discovered one day
>We sword fight with those most days when she comes over
>Either that or we play minecraft or CoD
>our comic was still ongoing and every now and then we advance the plot
>new characters etc.
>She's much more creative than me
>But I draw better
>We make a habit out of making a competition out of everything we do
>Friendly competition
>Everything is screaming at me to ask her out but I just cant do it for some reason
>She starts coming over every now and then
>We have a lot of fun together
>The swords are just about the best object I've ever owned
>So much fun is had with them
>You know how at the end of Monsters Inc. it was discovered that laughter was the best power source?
>We could've fueled a small country for years
>And as much as I want to, I cant bring myself to ask her out







>This girl has become my best, and really only, friend
>Slowly, ever so slowly the walls we put up for ourselves break down
>She's still happy most of the time but every now and then she needs a shoulder to cry on
>I provide this shoulder
>Turns out she has a lot of family drama
>Thats fine with me
>One day she's over at my house
>She seems a bit distracted while we play CoD
>Eventually after a while she sighs as if she's decided something
>She pulls out a little stack of papers seemingly from nowhere
>And hands them to me
>She says that it's a little segment of our comic she wrote
>I read it and the whole time I am Eliza looks at either the floor or the wall behind me
>Dak and Ella go into some cave
>Find a dungeon
>Ambushed my spiders
>And Dak gets his leg cut open by a skeleton's arrow
>Ella ends up dragging Dak out
>They're both in bad shape
>Ella realizes that they may die any day
>And with that in mind she kisses Dak, apparently something she's wanted to do for a long while
>Hint fucking hint
>I look up at Eliza and our eyes meet for a moment
>Then she looks away, her face flushed
>This is the part where you guys hate me /b/
>I didn't pull anything
>No kiss>Not even a hug
>All I said was "Pretty good."
>She looks dissapointed
>Fuck me








>So everything still continues as before
>I beat myself up over then next few months
>I mean what the fuck me?!
>I want to be with her
>So what the fuck is stopping me?
>I notice that she seems less interested now
>I may have missed my window
>After another week I convince myself that I definitely missed my window
>Fuck
>We're still friends but something seems to be missing now
>OP is a total betafag
>Right now though i feel like an omegafag
>She's given up
>She thinks I'm not interested
>But I am
>But its too late






>One day I read a betafag thread on 4chan
>I decide to man the fuck up because you guys are pathetic and thats not how I want to be
>She may have given up, but deep inside she still wants is
>Fuck the consequences, I'm going in
>In homeroom I tell her to come to my house on friday
>She agrees
>Friday rolls up
>She knocks on my door
>I open it and let her in
>She comes upstairs with me and starts to boot up the PS3
>I stop her
>I'm trying to get the words out but they're stuck
>Fuck my betafagness
>I had finally decided to do this and now I chicken out
>She's got a confused look on her face but I can make out hope behind it
>No
>Not again
>Instead of talking I decide actions are better
>Alpha impulse
>I stand her up and kiss her
>Like a CEO
>We pull away and she looks dumbfounded
>Then she goes on the offensive and kisses me
>So much win
