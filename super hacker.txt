/g/, every morning I wake up and I turn on my computer. I put my sunglasses on because the light hurts my eyes. I put on my typing gloves. I connect to the internet web through 8 proxies and then I hack until sundown. I'm probably the best hacker I know; I've hit banks, schools, doctors offices, oil tanks, farms, FedEx, Walmart, KFC, grocery stores. You name it, I probably hacked into it. I even have it set up where I can see the grocery transactions in my term window as they happen. I have 6 monitors hooked up in parallel, plus 1 digital eye piece that projects stats onto my eye. There's only one drink I know, and that's Jolt. Right after I'm finished hacking for the day, I read this and then fall asleep knowing I'm probably the most elite hacker on Earth, totally unstoppable:

"This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals."
