i remember seeing a car load of dudes at a stop light, yelling at a woman who was also at the red light with me

i guess they were trying to subvert the whole "dudes yelling crude shit from cars" thing

so they were like "HEY, HEY, WHAT'S YOUR MAJOR?"

"uh... english?"

"NICE. I RESPECT THAT. I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU TO A CAFE, DISCUSS LITERATURE."
"YEAH YOU SEEM LIKE AN INTELLIGENT GIRL WITH GOOD FASHION SENSE"
"I'D INTRODUCE YOU TO MY MOTHER"

then they drove off

she was bewildered

i couldn't breathe



Mines not that strange its just me being me.
I was driving this gas powered golf cart in some woods and saw a turkey and almost shit myself because I thought it was a 
velociraptor.
