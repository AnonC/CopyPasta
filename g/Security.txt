>Live in a very rural area
>Few neighbors, everyone owns guns
>Everything is stored on a server with encrypted HDDs that can only be decrypted with both the password and the serial number of the processor that the server uses (which is retrieved automagically)
>My entire home (especially server) has backup power for ~2 days, longer if the generator has more gas
>Server requires two keys to startup (not even joking) that must be turned simultaneously; only my wife and I have a key
>Password is ~32 Chars long from a pool of at least 92 different characters
>Six different backups as of a month ago, plus two more from further back that are set up to be decrypted with a different processor on the off chance that my current one fails
>Backup processor is kept in a separate lock box inside of a hidden safe
>Entirely closed-circuit, no outside connections allowed
>No DNS, not even over the local network
>MAC addresses of the computers who try to connect are logged and I am emailed if the server doesn't recognize/trust one
>If the right light switches in my home are in the correct position at any one moment, the server will power-down, reset bios, flush memory, restart, and run diagnostics for one day exactly before it can be used again
>A timed breaker will be reset for every cold-restart restarting the day-long process if the diagnostics were stopped before the one day passed
>The breaker can be reset by hand, but it requires a different two keys to open the box the breaker is housed in
