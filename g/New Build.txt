OP do you know how many threads we have on building a computer every day? There are dozens. And every time it's the same thing, "/g/, new to computer, do everything for me and I buy" or the classic "I want to play videogames so build me a computer". Well OP, as a seasoned /g/-browser, I'd like to tell you to go fuck yourself. Have you ever heard of Logical Increments? Well then go google it, you lazy worthless sack of shit. And as I sit here eating my Subway™ Tuscan Chicken Melt Sub™ I come to wonder, why is there such a constant influx of idiot aspies? One can only wonder, but I'll assume you are either from /v/ or /b/. I would also like to take a minute to tell you to go back to your cesspool of shit and to kindly not come back to /g/ unless you have something worthwhile to contribute. I'm not trying to be offensive to you, it's just that I hate lazy sperglords like you. You do know that the internet is a very large resource with a wealth of information right? Well did it ever come across your mind that somehow, _somewhere_, there might be a place that is actually dedicated to helping people with their first build, that isn't /g/? Of course it wouldn't, because you're a thoughtless shitstain. Your specs are shit, your build is shit, and you're shit. But what else is to be expected of a cock-mongling niglet of such status as yourself? As I stated before, go back to whatever cesspool of shit you came from, and please, never return here again.
