I hurt my /b/ today.
To see if the cancer is still there.
I trolled the newfags hard
The threat is still so real.
The copypasta tears them apart.
The old familiar rage.
Try to post original content,
but they wont see anything.
What has /b/ become, my sweetest friend.
Every meme we know, comes back as cancer in the end.
And you could have it all, moots advertising empire on /b/.
Newfags will let us down,
Snacks will make us hurt.
I wear this crown of memes
apon my oldfag chair.
Full of shit memes
