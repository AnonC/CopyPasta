Im just going to ramble here for a moment about the you think is to old for games.

It's basically by 30, you have a 9 to 5, maybe a wife/husband that you like to spend time with and friends that you meet after work or other times. By around 30-35 or so, you don't really have all the time you do now as a Uni student or full NEET. You work all day and come home, prepare dinner and sit down with your family, after you sit around for a little, you could fit some time for your hobby here, but you also have to get to bed early cause waking up early for more work, you may have kids that need some help with some mundane shit and most likely your wife will want some time with you watching the latest soap opera on TV, not everyday, but most of the time, say 3/5 days Monday to Friday.

Weekend will most likely be sleep in, house work and chores, shopping for food, Plenty of time there, but with work, you may have to do some more around time and time again to not get fired, spend time with the kids as they're most likely young.

You have the time, but really, do you? 
You have so much more to deal with your working and living and all the constraints that come with that independence.

You're never to old to play vidya, you just grow out of the time that you had as a 20 y/o uni student.
