I'm a 27 year old American underjordsbo (Scandinavian culture lover for you outlanders). I draw Norse runestones on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Scandinavian games. (Bad Company 2, Mirror's Edge, Max Payne)

I train with my dane axe every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is made from iron from the Scandinavian fjells: K?en, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my strids?s license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.

I speak Norse fluently, both Swedish and Norwegian dialects, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Scandinavian history and their ?ir code, which I follow 100 percent.

When I get my Finnish visa, I am moving to Helsinki to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent social welfare system. I hope I can become a skald or a game designer!

I own several horned helmets, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to Scandinavia, so I can fit in easier. I adress my elders and seniors by first name and speak Norse as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.

Anyone have some tips so I can fully experience the Scandinavian lifestyle?

Wish me luck in Finland!
