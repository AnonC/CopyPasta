I'd like to hurr for a moment. What you are referring as Durr, is in fact, Hurr/Durr, or as I've recently taken to herping it, Hurr plus Durr. Durr is not a hurp durp unto itself, but rather another hurr durr of a fully functioning derp made useful by the Hurr herps, derr utilities and vital herr components comprising a full hurrdurr as defined by HURPDURP.

Many derp users run a modified version of the Hurr system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Hurr which is widely used today is called Durr, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Durr system, developed by the Hurr Project.

There really is a Durr, and these people are herping it, but it is just a part of the derp they use. Hurr is the durr, the derpderp in the herpherp that hurps the durp's hurrs to the other durps that you hurp. The hurr is an essential part of a hurr, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete DURR. Durr is normally used in combination with the Hurr DURR: the whole durr is basically Hurr with Durr added, or Hurr/Durr. All the so-called durr distributions are really hurrs of Hurr/Durr.
