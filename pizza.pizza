Come on guys, lets take a step back and look at what we're doing. Look at how much money you're costing for the pizza places, and whatever else you decide to send to this innocent girls house. Imagine being the owner of that pizza place, and making $50 worth of pizza, only to have the delivery guy walk back to your place telling you that they didn't order it... Now you've just been robbed of $50 from some random assholes on the internet. Now take a step back and put yourself in this girls shoes. Imagine scrolling through your favorite image board only to fine multiple thread striping you from all your information. Sending pizzas to your house, strippers, ect. How would this make you people feel? Would you want the whole world to know where you live, where you work, and have multiple people you don't even know/associate with attempt to strip you from your own job? How would it feel to walk into the very place you worked for within the last two years only to have your boss walk you right out the door telling you that you are no longer allowed to work there because of a simple mistake you've made on the internet? All you assholes are doing is making fools of yourself. You're ruining the reputation that /b/ has gathered within the last seven years. People used to love this place, but now everyone is scared that if they make one wrong post, or post one image without censoring the right areas, that the people of /b/ will dox their entire profile, and end up sending all sorts of shit to their house just for the 'luls'.This is an absolute disgrace, and I hope every last one of you fuckers gets some sort of punishment for this.

Karma is a bitch, isn't it
