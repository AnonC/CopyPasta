So, /b/, here's my story:

Minutes ago I've arrived home from the new arcade, which is pretty awesome. They got this small stage with Guitar Hero, which was the first game (as I had never played before) I went to play. So to start off I choose a pretty easy song, and I get 98%, setting a new highscore and making some kids drop their jaws.

But there's more: In the middle of the small crowd of kids that formed behind me, there was this cute 10-year-old girl wearing long leather boots and, I think, was using lipstick. She was winking to me.

So I'm like, WTF, a 10-year-old girl is hitting on me. I didn't know how to react, and before I could think about anything a kid snatched the guitar off my hands and the girl wandered away (these two actions weren't related, I guess), and now I think about it, and if I should have done something.

What does Anonymous think?
