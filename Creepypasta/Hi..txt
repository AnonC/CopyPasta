Hi.
It's your good friend Jack Empty here.
If you're reading this, then you people on /x/ were so crazed for these stories that you all emptied my stash of it in no less than two nights.
Because of that, you get a reward, a link to downloading all of my spooky stories, freaky fables, creepy chronicles and terrifying tales.
Now, in here you will find what now should be a hundred and eleven stories, the first being 'The Song And Dance Man', the last being 'Camping'.
Well, what else can I say? Those were a fun couple of nights, and I truly believe I've kept at least one of you bastards up until the sun shone safety into your homes.
Some of you asked me where did I find all of these storied? Sentences like 'Oh, my god Jack, you're God on earth, where did you find all of those?', 'Jack, dear Lord, you give me such a boner, but where did you find all of these?'
and, 'Jack, please marry me, I'll be a good little pet, but where did you find so much?' appeared quite often, so I'll tell you my secret:
First and foremost, save what you like whenever you see it, keep it organized and properly named in a folder so you don't get confused and fuck shit up.
second, lurk a lot, there's possibilities of new pasta everyday. I'm  not telling you to become like a retarded /b/tard that spends all his hours either sleeping, eating, masturbating or lurking, do it in good measure and you'll be fine.
Third, watch out for good threads, ignore trolls and they go away, it's like the bully at school that you eventually gutted like the animal he was.
Fourth, /x/ is not the only source of good scares, below are some of the best sites for stories:

http://www.creepypasta.com/
http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Creepypasta
And, of course, /x/	
Fifth, when you're ready to display your collection, don't just dump, that way you won't know people's reaction to it (yes, I'm a genius).
Sixth, ????, right?
Seventh, I'm supposed to say 'profit' now, huh?
And remember, listen to Jethro Tull, learn to speak a third language, stop giving a shit, proof-read what you write, and an inappropriate smile is always scarier than a horrid face.
Your beloved,
~ Jack Empty.
