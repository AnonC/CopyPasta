Guns are for people with no lives and are for criminals. Guns are cheap and have no honor. Guns are evil and disgusting.

Swords, Swords are weapons Swords are honorable weapons of war. They require the welder to have skill. They require the beholder to have honor.
They are real weapons.

Guns are just plastic and metal thrown together to fire lead. And did I say guns are for chicken **** people as well?

The time it takes for you to figure out whether the person is coming at you with the sword and THEN cock it THEN load it and THEN arm it they could've dashed at you and killed you. So there you go.

seeing as i can stop bullets with my fingers i dont think a gun is very useful imo... now, swords are pretty cool.. Both weapons have alot of varitey but lets face it; swords have been around longer and they have more epic battles... now i'm not saying WWI and WWII weren't epic it's just... whats the fun in sitting in a smelly rat-infested trench waiting to get shot? back in the days were swords were the weapon of choice (along with the other weapons like maces, bows, laces, etc.) the battles were epic and fast paced. all i'm saying is that swords have been around for a long time and they are too 1337 to compare to most guns
